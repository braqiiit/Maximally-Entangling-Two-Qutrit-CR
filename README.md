# Realization of Maximally Entangling Two Qutrit Gates Using the Cross-Resonance Scheme

Three-level systems have natural advantages over their two-level counterparts in quantum information and computation. Although generally used for qubits, the existing superconducting transmon architecture can naturally be extended to three levels, which allows the exploration of the entire qutrit Hilbert space. Realizing a maximally entangling two-qutrit gate is necessary for universal quantum computation using three-level systems. Our work extends the state-of-the-art approach by providing a theoretical framework for realizing a high-fidelity two-qutrit generalized CR gate using the cross-resonance framework.
